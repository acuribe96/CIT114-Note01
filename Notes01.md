Module 1: Notes 01

What is Information Technology (IT)?
Computing power (CPU, RAM)
Storage (files and databases)
Networking (wired, wireless)
Security and identity management 
Management: billing and cost management 
Management compliance and governance; FERPA

Why is Information Technology Important?
Data overload: business need to process huge amounts of data 
Mobile and wireless users: more employees are offering remote work options that require smartphones, tablets, laptops with wireless hotspots and roaming
Cloud services: many businesses now with cloud services - 3rd party hosting platforms that maintain that data 
Bandwidth for video: video conferencing solutions have become more and more popular, needed to support

Hardware vs Software
Hardware includes all the physical aspects of an IT system
Software includes the data, application code, configuration files, etc that is stored digitally 
How do these relate to Cloud Computing? All elements related to hardware and software use the same terminology in the physical world as they do in the virtual cloud world

The Four Pillars of an IT Framework
Infrastructure: set of IT components that are the foundation of an IT service 
Development: process of writing and maintaining source code for software applications or frameworks
Security: maintains the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive info, blocking access of hackers
Data: represented through quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer are stored and recorded on magnetic, optical, or mechanical recording media and transmitted in the form of digital electrical signs

Common Terminology in IT
Job roles and occupations in IT
Computer components: motherboard, central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), and drive
Areas of information technology 

Terminology: Computer Components
Motherboard
Central processing unit (CPU)
Random access memory (RAM)
Storage drives
Expansion cards: graphic cards (GPU), audio cards, and networking components
Cooling 
Power supply
Case
Input and output devices
Peripherals 

Motherboard
Main circuit board of your computer and is also known as the main board, logic board, or system board
Components that attach to it either directly or part of it: central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), expansion cards (like graphics cards)
These components connect to the CPU via the buses, where a collection of chips and controllers known as the chipset
Motherboards have input and output ports: monitor (HDMI, Thunderbolt, VGA, DVI, etc), USB for keyboard and mouse, networking, and audio input/output
Depending on your needs these are different sizes, configurations, and form factors: standard ATX, micro ATX, mini ATX, nano ATX, pico ATX

Terminology: Firmware/BIOS
BIOS stands for ‘Basic Input/Output System’
A program pre-installed on Windows based computer was to start up
Located in ROM (read-only memory) chip of the computer
Resides in a erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) chip

Terminology: CPU
Central processing unit
Primary component of a computer that processes instructions 
Runs the operating system and application, constantly receiving input from the user or active software programs
Processes the data and produces output
Contains a minimum of one processor
CPU with two processing cores is called a dual-core
With four cores are called quad-core
High-end CPUs may have six (hexa-core) or even eight (octo-core)
A server with two hexa-core CPUs has a total of 12 processors

ARM Processor
ARM (advanced RISC machines) processor is a 32-bit RISC processor
RISC (reduced instruction set architecture)
ISA (instruction set architecture)
ARM processors are microprocessors used in mobile phones
PDAs (personal digital assistants), digital media, music layers, hand-held gaming systems, calculators, tablets, and computer hard drives

32-Bit and 64-Bit Architecture Processors
Found in laptops, workstations, or servers
Amount of info that your CPU can process each time it performs an operation
Difference between 32-bit and 64-bit is the number of calculations per second, which affects the speed
64-bit processors can come in dual-core, quad-core, six-core, and eight-core
32-bit support a maximum of 4GB
64-bit is 8TB of addressable RAM

Terminology: RAM
Random Access Memory
Made up of small memory chips that form a memory module
Every time you open a program, it gets loaded from the hard drive into the RAM
The more RAM your computer has, the more data can be loaded from the hard drive into the RAM, which can effectively speed up your computer
Adding RAM is more beneficial than upgrading the CPU

Terminology: Storage
Storage is where you keep files for your operating system, applications, and documents
Two types of storage devices: primary and secondary
Primary holds files for the operating system and any critical applications
Secondary can be removable, internal, or external and can be used to hold files or applications depending on setup
Two main types of storage: Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and Solid State Drive (SSD)

Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
Non-volatile memory hardware device that permanently stores and retrieves data on a computer
Secondary storage device that consists of one or more platters to which data is written using a magnetic head, all inside of an air-sealed casing
Internal hard disks reside in a drive bay, connect to the motherboard, and are powered by a connection to the PSU (power supply unit)
Computer cannot function without a hard drive

Solid State Drive (SSD)
Storage medium that uses non-volatile memory as a means of holding and accessing data
No moving parts which gives advantages such as faster access time, noiseless operation, higher reliability, and lower power consumption

Terminology: Expansion Cards/GPU
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
Many graphics cards can be used in place of the CPU for heaving processing loads
Cheaper to replace than a CPU
Printed circuit board that can be inserted into an expansion slot of a computer motherboard to add additional functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus
Can be used to obtain or expand on features not offered by the motherboard
Include, but not limited to: audio cards, graphics cards, network cards , TV runners, USB cards, and video capture 

Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
An electronic circuit used to speed up the creation of both 2D and 3D images
Can either be integrated into a computer's CPU or motherboard 
Can be dedicated, meaning they are a separate piece of hardware known as a video card
GPU allows the computers CPU resources to be used for other important tasks 
Part of High-Performance Computing in order to accelerate machine-learning or increase speed for advanced modeling of scientific calculations when used in cloud
Terminology: Misc
Power supplies, cooling, computer cases, input/output devices, and peripherals

Case
Encloses and holds most of the components of the system 
Provides support and protection for internal elements such as motherboard, disk drives, and power supplies
A laptop will have a laptop case, a server will have a specialized server case
For cloud computing, the case of servers tend to be designed to fit into racks and tend to be very short in height, but can be very long; only take cool are in from one side and exhaust from another

Fan
A hardware device that keeps the overall computer or a computer device cool by circulating air to or from the computer component
Speed of a fan is measured in revolutions per minute (RPM)
Higher the RPM rating, the faster the fan spins

Heat Sink
A device that incorporates either a fan or some other means to keep a hot component
Two types: active and passive
They utilize the computers power supply and may include a fan
Referred to as an HSF (heatsink and fan)
Passive sinks have no mechanical components
100% reliable
Made of an aluminum finned radiator that dissipates heat through convection

Liquid Cooling
A system used to reduce the temp of its hardware, specifically the CPU and GPU
Maintain desired operating temp
Begins with a pump that sends water into a water block, then the water absorbs thermal energy, it is passed to a heat exchange (usually a radiator) where a fan blows the heat out and cycle starts again

Power Supply
PSU converts alternating current (AC) electric power to a low-voltage direct current (DC) power for the internal components of their computer

Input/Output Devices
Allow the user to enter data into a system, or control its operation 
Devices include mouse and keyboard; touchpads, webcams, microphones, joysticks, and image scanners
